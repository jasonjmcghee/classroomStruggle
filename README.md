Classroom Struggle
=========================

I'm currently working with a campaign called Classroom Struggle, a group attempting to help reduce 
class sizes of certain schools in the Oakland Unified School District. In addition, they are working
to raise teachers' salaries (many of which are over ten thousand dollars less than those of neighboring
schools), raise teacher retention (the vast majority of teachers leave within 5 years), and push the 
district to choose ways other than test scores to determine funding for schools.

My job, along with a few other students that attend UCB, is to do research in order to find out as much
as we can about the current state of OUSD, including all of the previously mentioned metrics. During
that process, I thought it would be a great supplement to the statistics and other research to create
a visualization so people could quickly look and understand the staggering problems which reside in the
OUSD. Hopefully I'll be able to improve my abilities in data visualization enough so that I may have
an impact on the campaign.
